The user is prompted to enter a qualification code which is either 'F' or 'R' where F is for facuties and R is for regular employees.
It then calculates the total salary based on the factors such as number of hours worked, overtime, less than required hours and health benefits taken or not. 
The overall or total salary is generated on a pay slip which is the front end web page for the type of employee entered by the user.
